	Most kids learn to read and write by reading books, but many kids learn to love reading and writing by reading poetry books. Often, when children develop an interest in reading poetry, they begin to try their hand at the craft. Children have a special way of amusing and inspiring adults with their innocence on a daily basis. For this reason, no one should underestimate a child's ability to turn their everyday lives, their perceptions of the world around them, and their deepest emotions into poems that can be humorous, enlightening, intelligent, touching, devastating, or just plain adorable.
